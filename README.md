# infodb

Infodb aims to solve the problem of feeling out-of-touch with events happening in the world by combining multiple news sources inside of one app.  
The app will poll the most popular news sites every so often and group the articles based on the date of publication and associated tags, allowing users to easily get up to date on what's happening (or what has happened some time ago in regard to a specific topic)  

As of now the project is in a prototype stage. The final goal is to make it a Spring Boot powered web-app.
